Build **Data** **Ingestion** **Service** that will handle the ingestion,
transformation, and storage of data from multiple sources. It will
ensure eﬃcient, secure, and scalable data processing in both batch and
real-time modes, and facilitate smooth integration with other systems.

> **Scope**

This Data Integration Service will:

> ● Ingest data from various sources (ﬁles, APIs, databases). ●
> Transform the data as needed.
>
> ● Store the processed data into multiple storage backends (relational
> databases, NoSQL, cloud storage).

**Data** **Ingestion** **Service** **Requirements**

1\. Functional Requirements

> 1\. Data Source Integration:
>
> ○ The service should be able to integrate with multiple data sources
> (e.g., ﬁles, databases, APIs).
>
> ○ Support for batch and real-time data ingestion.
>
> ○ Provide connectors for common data formats (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.).
> 2. Data Transformation:
>
> ○ Ability to preprocess and transform data before saving or forwarding
> it.
>
> ○ Support for common transformation tasks (e.g., ﬁeld mapping, data
> validation). 3. Error Handling:
>
> ○ Graceful error handling and logging.
>
> ○ Deﬁne a retry mechanism for failed ingestion attempts. 4. Data
> Storage:
>
> ○ Ability to ingest and store data into cloud storage or local drive.
> Data can be ingested in batches or in real-time, and the service
> should be capable of storing large ﬁles (e.g., Parquet, CSV) eﬃciently
> in these systems.
>
> ○ Optionally, support for cloud storage (e.g., Azure blob Storage).
>
> ○ Use of batch processing for large datasets and stream processing for
> real-time data. 5. Data Monitoring and Auditing:
>
> ○ Track data ingestion progress and failures.
>
> ○ Provide audit logs for all ingestion operations for traceability. 6.
> API Support:
>
> ○ Expose RESTful APIs to trigger ingestion tasks.
>
> ○ Provide endpoints for querying ingestion status and logs.
>
> ○ Ability to conﬁgure and manage data ingestion jobs through APIs.

2\. Non-Functional Requirements

> 1\. Adherence to SOLID principles and best practices to ensure code
> maintainability. 2. Comprehensive logging and exception handling
> mechanisms to ease debugging. 3. Unit and integration tests for
> critical components.
>
> 4\. The service must be ﬂexible to support additional data sources and
> formats in the future.
>
> 5\. Design the system so that adding new transformation or storage
> strategies can be done with minimal code changes.
>
> 6\. Programming language Java or Python and choose any suitable
> framework.
